# Traffic-Rush
car game created in python

In order to run the project, all you need to do is run the Term-Project-Main.py
file. Along with this, you need to make sure that the TP-Images folder and the
leaderboard.txt file are at the same level as the python file in order to
properly display certain images and texts on the project. Enjoy :)
